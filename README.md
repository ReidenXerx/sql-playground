## Enhancements

1. **Design Improvements**. I have introduced a comprehensive redesign. A prominent feature is the adoption of a split-screen layout, which is common in similar projects and enhances usability. The color scheme and overall visual style have been modified to adopt a "homebrew" aesthetic, adding a charming touch to the interface.

2. **Code Editor Integration**. A fully functional code editor has been integrated into the left pane of the split-screen interface. This feature allows users to develop SQL code conveniently, enhanced by syntax highlighting for improved readability.

3. **Robust Error Handling**. Given the potential for inconsistencies in the data source, I have developed a resilient error handling mechanism. This approach enhances the system's fault tolerance in dealing with inconsistent data.

4. **Virtualization**. Considering that the data output could be significantly large, I have integrated virtualization into the right pane of the split-screen output window to optimize performance.

5. **Input Validation**. Recognizing that some characters can be problematic in SQL development, I implemented a real-time validation system in the code editor. This feature ensures that the user's input is appropriately sanitized and prevents the introduction of unwanted characters.

6. **Notification System**. To enhance user interaction and comprehension, I have integrated a notification system. This feature makes the product experience more interactive and intuitive.

7. **Dynamic Loader System**. To improve the user experience during potentially long API responses, I implemented a dynamic loader system. Instead of a static screen, users will see an animated loader indicating the ongoing process.

8. **Concurrent Independent Requests**. To boost performance and provide a seamless user experience, I designed a system that sends SQL and PVML requests simultaneously. The system monitors the statuses and loaders of each request independently. This approach ensures a fluid and efficient process without compromising clarity for the user.
