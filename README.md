## Scripts overview

npm run +
```javascript
"dev": "vite",
"build": "tsc && vite build",
"test": "jest",
"lint": "eslint src --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
"preview": "vite preview"
```

## Enhancements

1. **Design Improvements**. I have introduced a comprehensive redesign. A prominent feature is the adoption of a split-screen layout, which is common in similar projects and enhances usability. The color scheme and overall visual style have been modified to adopt a "homebrew" aesthetic, adding a charming touch to the interface.

2. **Code Editor Integration**. A fully functional code editor has been integrated into the left pane of the split-screen interface. This feature allows users to develop SQL code conveniently, enhanced by syntax highlighting for improved readability.

3. **Robust Error Handling**. Given the potential for inconsistencies in the data source, I have developed a resilient error handling mechanism. This approach enhances the system's fault tolerance in dealing with inconsistent data.

4. **Virtualization**. Considering that the data output could be significantly large, I have integrated virtualization into the right pane of the split-screen output window to optimize performance.

5. **Input Validation**. Recognizing that some characters can be problematic in SQL development, I implemented a real-time validation system in the code editor. This feature ensures that the user's input is appropriately sanitized and prevents the introduction of unwanted characters.

6. **Notification System**. To enhance user interaction and comprehension, I have integrated a notification system. This feature makes the product experience more interactive and intuitive.

7. **Dynamic Loader System**. To improve the user experience during potentially long API responses, I implemented a dynamic loader system. Instead of a static screen, users will see an animated loader indicating the ongoing process.

8. **Concurrent Independent Requests**. To boost performance and provide a seamless user experience, I designed a system that sends SQL and PVML requests simultaneously. The system monitors the statuses and loaders of each request independently. This approach ensures a fluid and efficient process without compromising clarity for the user.

## Technology Overview

This project uses a variety of modern tools and libraries to build a powerful and responsive user interface. The list below outlines the major technologies used:

1. **React (v18.2.0)**: The core of the application is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. **TypeScript (v5.0.2)**: TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, is used to ensure type safety and make the codebase more robust and easier to maintain.

3. **Vite (v4.3.9)**: This project uses Vite as a build tool for a faster and leaner development experience. Vite provides features like hot-module replacement and fast production builds.

4. **Material UI (v5.13.4)**: Material UI is a widely-used React UI framework with a set of pre-built components that follow Material Design guidelines. It provides a consistent and attractive look and feel for the application.

5. **Emotion (v11.11.1)**: Emotion is a library designed for writing CSS styles with JavaScript. It is used for component styling throughout the project.

6. **React Window (v1.8.9)**: This library is used to efficiently render large lists and tabular data. It improves performance by only rendering items that are currently visible.

7. **React Simple Code Editor (v0.13.1) and Prismjs (v1.29.0)**: These are used to provide a code editing interface with syntax highlighting. It offers a great user experience for writing and editing SQL code.

8. **React Toastify (v9.1.3)**: React Toastify allows the application to show notifications to the user in an elegant way.

9. **ESLint (v8.38.0)**: ESLint is used for enforcing code style and maintaining consistency across the codebase.

10. **Prettier (v2.8.8)**: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures the codebase follows a consistent style.

In conclusion, the tech stack used for this project allows for the creation of a modern, efficient, and user-friendly interface, while also ensuring that the code remains clean, maintainable, and efficient.
